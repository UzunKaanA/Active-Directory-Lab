# Active Directory Overview

## üîê What is Active Directory?

**Active Directory (AD)** is a directory service developed by Microsoft, designed to streamline the management of IT infrastructure in medium and large-scale organizations. Its core function is to provide a **centralized, secure, and manageable** way to control all digital resources within an organization.

### üè¢ Why Use Active Directory in Corporate Environments?

Managing hundreds of users, computers, printers, and servers manually is a daunting task. Active Directory simplifies this by enabling:

- Centralized management of users and groups
- Configuration of password policies and security settings
- Application of uniform configurations across network computers
- Control of access permissions
- Regulation of resource access (e.g., who can access shared files?)

### üß± Core Components

1. **Domain**: A logical structure grouping all users and resources, managed via a domain name (e.g., `example.com`).
2. **Domain Controller (DC)**: The server hosting the AD database and handling authentication.
3. **Organizational Units (OU)**: Subfolders for organizing users, groups, and computers, used for policy management.
4. **Group Policy**: Tools for centrally enforcing policies, from desktop settings to software deployments.
5. **LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)**: The protocol used for AD communication.

### üë• User Management

AD creates individual user accounts, enabling:

- Secure login to company computers
- Access to file servers
- Connection to printers
- Authorized use of integrated systems like email

### üîê Security Benefits

- Restricts access to authorized resources only
- Centralizes firewall and password policy enforcement
- Detects and blocks unauthorized access attempts

üîç Overview
This project involves setting up a virtual Active Directory (AD) environment using Windows Server 2022 and Windows 10 clients. The goal is to simulate a real-world enterprise domain environment, understand authentication, user/group management, and basic Group Policy Objects (GPOs).

Tools & Technologies Used
VirtualBox
Windows Server 2022 ISO
Windows 10 ISO
Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
DNS
Group Policy Management Console (GPMC)

# Active Directory Lab

üéØ **Project Objective**  
This project aims to create a virtual Active Directory Domain environment using **Windows Server 2022** and **Windows 10 Client** machines. The objective is to simulate enterprise-level **identity management**, **user/group administration**, **DNS/DHCP configuration**, and **Group Policy** implementation.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies Used
- **VirtualBox**
- **Windows Server 2022 ISO**
- **Windows 10 ISO**
- **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)**
- **DNS / DHCP Server**
- **Group Policy Management Console (GPMC)**

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Server Setup and Domain Controller Configuration
1. Created a virtual machine in **VirtualBox** using the **Windows Server 2022 ISO**.
   ![Alt text](images/server.png)
2. Assigned a **static IP address** to the server.
   ![Alt text](images/image1.png)
3. From **Server Manager**:
   - Navigated to **Manage > Add Roles and Features**.
   - Installed the **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)** role.
   - ![Alt text](images/image3.png)
   - Promoted the server to a **Domain Controller**.
4. Created a new forest and domain: **kaanlab.local**.
   ![Alt text](images/image4.png)
5. Completed setup with default options and defined the **DSRM password**.
   ![Alt text](images/image5.png)
6. **DNS configuration** was automatically handled (Forward Lookup Zone).
7. Manually created a **Reverse Lookup Zone** using the server IP address.
8. Installed the **DHCP Server** role and created a new **IPv4 Scope** for IP distribution.

## üß© Joining the Client Machine to the Domain
1. Created a second VM using **Windows 10** on the same virtual network.
   ![Alt text](images/client.png)
3. Verified network settings with `ipconfig /all`, ensuring correct **DNS** and **DHCP** configurations.
4. Pinged the server to confirm network connectivity.
5. Joined the domain **kaanlab.local** via:
   - **This PC > System Properties > Domain**.
   - Entered **domain administrator credentials**.
6. Successfully logged into the client machine using a domain account.

---

## üë§ User and Group Management
1. Created a new group (e.g., **IT_Department**) within the domain structure.
2. Created a new user (e.g., **kaan.uzun**) and assigned them to the group.
3. Logged into the domain-joined client using the new user credentials.

## üõ°Ô∏è Group Policy Management

## Group Policy Management

The **Group Policy Management Console (GPMC)** was utilized to create a new **Group Policy Object (GPO)** linked to the domain.

As a demonstration, a **desktop wallpaper policy** was configured and applied to users.

The policy was enforced on the client machine using the `gpupdate /force` command, with successful validation of functionality.

---

### üë• Computer vs. User Configuration

Group Policy settings are categorized into two primary types:

#### **Computer Configuration**
- Policies applied at the machine level, activated during computer startup.
- Independent of the logged-in user.
- Examples:
  - Startup scripts
  - Security settings
  - Software installations
  - Firewall rules

#### **User Configuration**
- Policies applied when a specific user logs in, regardless of the machine.
- Examples:
  - Desktop wallpaper
  - Login scripts
  - Software restrictions tailored to user identity

---

### üß© Other Policy Examples

While the wallpaper policy served as a simple example in this project, **Group Policy Objects** support a wide array of configurations commonly used in enterprise environments, including:

- **Software Restriction Policies**: Prevent users from running unauthorized applications.
- **Software Deployment**: Automatically install software on client machines via GPO.
- **Password Policies**: Enforce minimum length, complexity, and rotation requirements.
- **Logon Scripts**: Execute scripts at user logon to map network drives or printers.
- **USB Device Restrictions**: Restrict access to removable storage for enhanced security.
- **Windows Update Management**: Centrally manage update schedules and configurations.

For the illustration:

1. Opened the **Group Policy Management Console**.
2. Created a new **Group Policy Object (GPO)** and linked it to the domain.
3. Configured a sample **wallpaper policy** under **User Configuration** settings.
4. Applied the policy and updated the client using `gpupdate /force`.
5. Verified successful policy enforcement on the client machine.
